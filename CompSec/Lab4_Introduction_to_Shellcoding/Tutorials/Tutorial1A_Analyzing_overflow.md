# Buffer overflow problems

There is a quite descriptive phrase about the problem: "Buffer overflows are Mother Nature's little reminder of that law of physics that says: if you try to put more stuff into a container than it can hold, you're going to make a mess."

In practice, *software* buffer overflow means that the space reserved for data is insufficient for the data being stored.

Conversely, buffer over-read means that read processing might read more than it should.

Some high-level programming languages (C/C++/Objective-C) are enabling direct memory management and are not checking input against storage to prevent buffer overflows, and therefore making it possible to cause buffer overflow, when *input data* is improperly validated or sanitized. (In most cases: user input)

When we are talking about user input, we might think about text at first, but this input could be anything: for example images, pdf -, audio - or video files.

The are two basic categories for overflows:

* stack overflows - data in the stack is overflowed

* heap overflows - data in the dynamically allocated memory is overflowed

Heap overflows are rare and challenging to exploit. We are getting better examples from stack overflows and therefore focusing on them.

## Stack overflows

We mentioned data and the space it required. Insufficient space could cause overflow, but where and how more precisely?

Vast majority of current modern computer computation uses stack to storage local data. Stack is pile of data, what is controlled with FILO (first in, last out) method.
In most of the current operating systems, each application has its own stack.
Stack is a region in computer memory, starting from higher address, growing to lower address.

When application is executed, stack and registers are used for handling the execution flow of the program. Stack is divided into frames, where each of them contains non-exited function of the program.
Each function contains data of local variables, possible called function parameters, function return addresses etc. For example, nesting three function calls in program could open three stack frames.

More precise information is provided [here.](http://www.tenouk.com/Bufferoverflowc/Bufferoverflow2a.html)

The place or reason, why stack overflow happens, is usually local variable. The size for variable is defined as smaller than it is possible to acquire data for it.

Let's have a look on stack. Each line in the following table describes data in correct order inside stack. The structure of stack can vary based on operating system.

*higher memory address* :arrow_up:

Data type|Address|Data|Comment|
-|-|-|-
Function 1 parameter I|0xAB08 | 0x4141| Parameter 1(AA in ascii) passed to function
Function 1 parameter II|0xAB06 | 0x4242| Parameter 2(BB in ascii) passed to function
Function 1 return address|0xAB04 | 0x????| Place where function returns after completion
Function 1 Saved EBP address|0xAB02 | 0xAB09| Stack pointer of previous frame
Function 1 Local variable I|0xAB00 | 0x0000| Reserved space for local variable, in this case 10 bytes
Function 2 parameter I|0xAAFB | 0x4343| CC in ascii
Function 2 etc...|... | ...| ...
Buffer|... | ...| Available stack space

*lower memory address* :arrow_down: *stack grows*

**Stack overflow happens** in this case, if we put more than 10 bytes of data to function 1 local variable I. Data which is unable to fit variable, flows to higher memory address, in this case, first to saved EBP address, and so on.

## Buffer overflow example 1: tampering with data

### How to get access to data?

```c
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <string.h>

int main(void) { 

char buffer[15];
int testValue = 0; 

printf("\n Enter security code to print secret >"); 
gets(buffer);

if(strcmp(buffer, "CSE-Oulu")) { 
printf ("\n Wrong Password \n");
    } 
else { 
testValue = 1; 
}

if(testValue){ 
/* Do something*/
printf ("My secret: I love Assembly language"); 
    } 
return 0; 
}
```

## Buffer overflow – solution 1

* Yes, yes, of course, you could just examine the program file, because we have not taken any steps to protect the security code or the secret:

```shell
$ gcc -o overflow overflow.c
$ hexdump –C overflow

00000730  0a 45 6e 74 65 72 20 73  65 63 75 72 69 74 79 20   |.Enter security |

00000750  63 72 65 74 3e 00 25 73  00 43 53 45 2d 4f 75 6c   |cret>.%s.CSE-Oul|

00000770  0a 4d 79 20 73 65 63 72  65 74 3a 20 49 20 6c 6f   |.My secret: I lo|
00000780  76 65 20 41 73 73 65 6d  62 6c 79 20 6c 61 6e 67   |ve Assembly lang|
00000790  75 61 67 65 00 00 00 00  01 1b 03 3b 34 00 00 00   |uage.......;4...|
```

## Buffer overflow – solution 2

* The program works:

```shell
$ ./overflow
Enter security code to print secret>ohno
Wrong code!
$ ./overflow
Enter security code to print secret>CSE-Oulu
My secret: I love Assembly language
```

* Or does it?

```shell
$ ./overflow
Enter security code to print secret>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Wrong code!
My secret: I love Assembly language
$ ./overflow
Enter security code to print secret>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Wrong code!
My secret: I love Assembly language
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

* What if the overflow could reach an area of memory, where the execution will branch to later?
* Then, the malevolent input could be crafted to include machine language instructions, that the unwitting buggy program would then execute.
* Or what if the program allows to read more data than intended? This could lead information leak of unprivileged areas, and maybe even enabling new attack vectors.


How easy is it to change execution flow of this program? Let's have a look in following chapter.
```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void stackoverflow(char* string) {
    char buffer[20];
    strcpy(buffer, string);
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    printf("Starting very vulnerable program...\n");
    printf("Printing arguments of the program: \n");
    stackoverflow(argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
```
# Analyzing simple program with buffer overflow vulnerability

Usually, when overflow occurs, we are just seeing 'Segmentation Fault' error or strange behavior in program... or maybe nothing at all. That is not too precise information.
We can use GNU Debugger for example to see, what's actually happening, when we are executing the program.

Some parts in this tutorial are not revealed nor fully explained, in purpose of to readers to find out or explain themselves. Buffer size of program is different in above code example.

Example of overflowing program with input, which is actually limited to some size inside program. Function 'stackoverflow' contains buffer overflow, and we are changing it's return address.

This 64-bit example is using Python script to generate argument for actual
program. We will have a look for register contents.

Here is a short intro to the usage of gdb, if it is not familiar beforehand:
https://mohit.io/blog/gdb-assembly-language-debugging-101/

rip            0x4000000100	0x4000000100

```
ASCII Hex-value for 'A' is 41. We can see how it is currently filling rcx and rdx registers, which are usually used for passing 4th and 3rd argument to functions. 
If we go little bit further and overflow some more...


```shell
(gdb) r "$(python -c 'print("A" * 20)')"
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y
Starting program: /root/Desktop/Shellcode/test "$(python -c 'print("A" * 20)')"

#Looking rip register with input size of 20x A characters
rip            0x555555004141	0x555555004141
#Looking at rip register with input size of 21x A characters
rip            0x555500414141	0x555500414141
```

Finally rip register is getting filled with 'A's. This register is somehow meaningful to us.

Let's go some steps back and look a bit deeper.
We suppose now, that our program has function, where this overflow actually occurs. (In this case, instruction +29 uses that function named as *stackoverflow*.) We disassemble the main function, and see the addresses of each instruction:

```shell
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x0000555555554771 <+0>:	push   %rbp
   0x0000555555554772 <+1>:	mov    %rsp,%rbp

   0x0000555555554799 <+40>:	retq   
End of assembler dump.
```
Address right after stackoverflow function is: **0x0000555555554793**
This is important, as some point we should get into this instruction after completing 'stackoverflow' function.

**This time, execute program without a making buffer overflow**

Let's stop execution of program inside this stackoverflow function, just before the 'unsafe' instruction (in this case: standard library function allowing the buffer overflow), right after it and just before returning from this function, *by using breakpoints in gdb:*

```shell
Dump of assembler code for function stackoverflow:

   0x000055555555473f <+1>:	mov    %rsp,%rbp

End of assembler dump.

```
Execute, and after first breakpoint:
Let's have a look for current stack of the program.
There is an interesting address from our main function: **0x55554793**. This was the address of instruction in main function right after of our stackoverflow function.
```shell
Breakpoint 1, 0x0000555555554758 in stackoverflow ()
(gdb) x/20x $rsp
0x7fffffffe160:	0x00000001	0x00000000	0xffffe597	0x00007fff
0x7fffffffe170:	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000
0x7fffffffe180:	0xffffe1a0	0x00007fff	0x55554793	0x00005555
0x7fffffffe190:	0xffffe288	0x00007fff	0x00000000	0x00000002
0x7fffffffe1a0:	0x555547a0	0x00005555	0xf7a42f2a	0x00007fff
(gdb) 
```
Let's continue the execution to breakpoint 2.
Now we have passed by the potential unsafe instruction, what we haven't overflowed this time.
```shell
Breakpoint 2, 0x000055555555475d in stackoverflow ()
(gdb) x/20x $rsp
0x7fffffffe160:	0x00000001	0x00000000	0xffffe59d	0x00007fff
0x7fffffffe170:	0x41414100	0x41414141	0x41414141	0x00414141
0x7fffffffe180:	0xffffe1a0	0x00007fff	0x55554793	0x00005555
0x7fffffffe190:	0xffffe288	0x00007fff	0x00000000	0x00000002
0x7fffffffe1a0:	0x555547a0	0x00005555	0xf7a42f2a	0x00007fff
(gdb) 
```
We can see, that address of **0x55554793** is still there. Additionally stack contains some 'A' letters, what we have used as input.
Let's execute to final breakpoint:



```shell
Breakpoint 3, 0x0000555555554770 in stackoverflow ()
(gdb) x/20x $rsp
0x7fffffffe188:	0x55554793	0x00005555	0xffffe288	0x00007fff
0x7fffffffe198:	0x00000000	0x00000002	0x555547a0	0x00005555
0x7fffffffe1a8:	0xf7a42f2a	0x00007fff	0x00000000	0x00000000
0x7fffffffe1b8:	0xffffe288	0x00007fff	0x00040000	0x00000002
0x7fffffffe1c8:	0x55554771	0x00005555	0x00000000	0x00000000
(gdb)
```
So, the 3rd breakpoint was in last instruction (retq) of stackoverflow function. Looking at the stack above, current rsp is the address in main function, the one right after our stackoverflow function. Program should end normally, if we still continue. We have executed program without making buffer overflow.

What is the content of stack if we the execute program, by causing the buffer overflow to program?

Stack information in first breakpoint should stay same, but let's have a look on second breakpoint again, which is right after when overflow occurs.
```shell
(gdb) r $(python -c 'print("A" * 26)')
Starting program: /root/Desktop/Shellcode Lab2/Overflow $(python -c 'print("A" * 26)')

Continuing.

(gdb) 

```
With suitable amount of buffer overflow, our 'A' letters starts to fill more addresses than they should, replacing previously seen address **0x55554793**.

It's essential to think how stack works:
When function is called, arguments are usually passed backwards into stack before the actual calling of function. (Depending also on complier: 64 - bit systems could be using fastcall, which means that four first parameters are coming from registers.) Next, address where function should return, and old rbp address are pushed to stack.

Further, local variables have been defined, and suitable space in stack is reserved for them.

Continue to last breakpoint:
```shell
Breakpoint 3, 0x0000555555554770 in stackoverflow ()
(gdb) x/20x $rsp
0x7fffffffe178:	0x00414141	0x00005555	0xffffe278	0x00007fff
0x7fffffffe188:	0x00000000	0x00000002	0x555547a0	0x00005555
0x7fffffffe198:	0xf7a42f2a	0x00007fff	0x00000000	0x00000000
0x7fffffffe1a8:	0xffffe278	0x00007fff	0x00040000	0x00000002
0x7fffffffe1b8:	0x55554771	0x00005555	0x00000000	0x00000000
(gdb) 
```
Current rsp address is not the instruction address (0x55554793) in main function anymore.

If we continue executing the program:

```
(gdb) stepi
0x0000555500414141 in ?? ()
(gdb) nexti

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0000555500414141 in ?? ()
(gdb) 
(gdb) print /x $rip
$1 = 0x555500414141
```

Rip register contains data, which we passed as input. What in practice this could mean?
