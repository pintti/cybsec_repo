*Give at least the above information to this file. You can remove all below if you like, and add some of your own general instructions/information if you like.*


## What is this repository for?


This repository is meant for returning all of the tasks that you are doing in labs.

The actual instructions for the tasks are [here.](https://github.com/ouspg/CompSec)

You will update and add all of your work on the laboratory exercises into this repository during the course.


## How to proceed?

For each lab, you have to choose:
 * Take the weekly exam in Moodle.
 * Make the lab assignment, add your answers here and return the link to this repository in Moodle. Max. grade is five (5).

 **OR**

 * Only take the weekly exam in Moodle. All of them must be passed to pass the course.


There is a corresponding template for each laboratory exercise in this repository.

There is a template for text (README.md) in each template folder. You can remove all the questions if you want, as long as you are saving the task numbers.

You can create a folder named *src* for the possible source code in each folder.

You can create a folder named *img* for the possible images/screenshots in each folder.

It is recommended to do as described above, but it is not required (= you can add more things if you like).


*If you are taking only weekly exams instead of the corresponding lab, you don't have to fill this template.*


Check the [cheat sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) if you need a refresher on how to use Git. Some basic commands below  
```git
git add </path/filename>
git commit -m "<message>"
git push
```

If you have barely edited Markdown files, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good free software for editing and showing the live preview of it. It works on Windows, Linux and Macintosh. It is also installed on most of the virtual machines (VSCodium version, telemetry is disabled.). For help with Markdown syntax, check [Example.md](Example.md)
## When to proceed?

There is a deadline for each lab.

When you have done the exercises of the corresponding lab, you have to return the link (URL) of this repository into [Moodle](https://moodle.oulu.fi) into the corresponding returning box ***before the deadline*** on Monday.

If you reach at least 3 points/level by that deadline, you may submit your work into the return box and ask for extra time to do more difficult tasks if you think that the given time is not enough for more challenging tasks.

In that case, your work is attempted to be graded ASAP on Tuesday and if it is sufficient you will be given short feedback and an extended deadline. This offers possibilities for improvements as well!

> **Note**
> You can return the link beforehand and edit the corresponding lab still here, as long as it has been done before the deadline.

In practice, if you have done all of the six (6) labs, you return this same link six (6) times for different return boxes.

This is because:

 * We can track if you have done the corresponding lab in each time. We know that there is something to review.

 * We can link the correct person to the correct repository (= We know who has actually edited this repository)

 * There are people, who might only take weekly exams or some mix of
 both (labs and exam today, but only exam next week).

 * Private GitHub repositories can be more accessible than one hundred zip files.

 If you want to make ChipWhisperer lab beforehand (and it is recommended), *you can borrow the device, but not for infinite time!.* You might be able to borrow it again.

 Just take care that you have returned the link before the deadline, and the corresponding lab of the deadline has been completed here.
