Add all your group member's names and student IDs here. If you continue the tasks at home, you can work with different people. Please mark who participated in which tasks.

# Task 1
### Inspecting power differences of operations

Replace the following screenshot.

It should contain your custom power trace where you execute any amount of nops AND muls. You need to execute atleast 10 lines worth of each command and in total atleast 40 lines worth of assembly code. You are not required to execute the commands in 10 line chuncks and you can execute also any other assembly commands besides nop and mul.

Please have your screenshots roughly in the same scale as the placeholders. If your whole trace doesn't fit to that scale then you can of course take a larger picture.

Remember also add textual descriptions of images if they are needed.

#### Trace with your custom set of operations
