# **Week 4**

## Task 1

Side-channel attacks are attacks that use information that leaks from within the system. This information can be physical characteristics, like sound, power consumption or electromagnetic radiation. Side-channel attacks usually target devices that can be easily accessed, such as mobile devices and embedded systems, but modern side-channel attacks can also be used against VMs and web applications.

Side-channel attacks use a wide variety of information to do their attacks, all depending on the target and the type of attack. Physical information can be electromagnetic radiation or radio waves, that can then be used to reconstruct internal signal within the target device. Power consumption is also usual target information, as that can be used to infer the activity within the system. Timing systems is also a very often used information for side-channel attacks, through which the attacker can predict the victim systems behaviour.

Memory caches can also be abused to do side-channel attacks. Memory caches were used for Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities. These two vulnerabilities abused transient execution in CPUs. These were mitigated through patches, which hopefully made attacks impossible. The patches contained BIOS and OS updates, but did not (or rather could not) patch the microarchitectural vulnerabilities which caused the attacks in the first place.

## Task 2

Slowloris is a type of DDoS attacks that abuses multiple incomplete HTTP requests to overload the server and prevent any more connections to be made. The attack works by having the attacking machine open up multiple HTTP requests towards the target site. Rather than most high bandwidth attacks, slowloris attempts to make the requests that might seem slower than normal, but are considered otherwise regular traffic. As the target gets the requests, it opens up threads that are trying to stay alive for the requests to complete. As these never complete, the servers connection amount will eventually exceed its capacity and the denial of service will be complete.

Slowloris can be mitigated by limiting the number of concurrent connections from a single IP address, increasing server capacity (although it is likely the attacker will increase their attacks in response), adjusting server timeouts to close incomplete connections quicker and employing load balancers or reverse proxies to distribute the incoming connections. There are also security modules and plugins that can be used to detect and block Slowloris attacks.

Slowloris gained notoriety when it was used during the 2009 Iranian presidential election, where hackivists used slowloris to strike down pro-regime sites. Slowloris was used in addition to regular DDoS attacks, to make sure the sites would stay down.

## **Task 3**: BurpSuite Introduction

In this exercise we will take a brief look at a popular web security testing tool called BurpSuite. The exercise requires quite a lot of setup and running an intentionally vulnerable web application (although locally), so using a Virtual Linux Machine is heavily recommended. All the following instructions will be for **Linux only**  

**Needed tools:**  
Virtual Machine (Linux)  
Firefox with FoxyProxy  
BurpSuite Community Edition  
Docker Engine  
Damn Vulnerable Web Application DVWA  

**Returnable file**  
File that you should return will be a PDF that contain clear screenshots of requested tasks and few explanations. This file should be returned to the Moodle return box.  

### Installing Burpsuite

To install the free community edition of BurpSuite go to https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload  

You will have to provide an email to be able to download the application. The Community Edition has some drawbacks, but they will not hinder us in this exercise.

In terminal, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the file. The file name may vary, **burpsuite_community_linux_v2023_2_3.sh** is just a current example. Run the following commands to create an executable and run the installer. First command will create an executable and the second command will run it.

>chmod +x burpsuite_community_linux_v2023_2_3.sh  
>./burpsuite_community_linux_v2023_2_3.sh

After this you should be able to find BurpSuite in your installed programs.  

### Installing Docker Engine

For Linux (Ubuntu), follow the guide on the official page https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

For first time setup, follow the steps from "Install using the apt repository" to the step where you verify the successful installation of Docker by running the "hello-world" image.  

### Setting things up  

#### BurpSuite Proxy  

Start BurpSuite on your virtual machine. Open a Temporary project and use BurpSuite defaults. You should land on the Dashboard of BurpSuite.  

We need to set the scope and target for BurpSuite proxy, so we only catch traffic that we want to see. Navigate to *Target* Tab and click on *Scope settings*  

![burp4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225859733-92feb908-625b-4371-8000-ccdf3d53a45a.PNG)

We will host our testing site in *localhost*.  

In Project Scope section, add http://localhost/ to the included scope. End result should look like this  

![burp1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225859849-4211d1b4-06e7-4bbc-a817-bc737e0a96fc.PNG)

When BurpSuite asks about Proxy history logging of out-of-scope items, click "Yes"  

Under Tools, select the Proxy tab and check that the parts highlighted in red match. Usually you should only need to enable the highlighted Request interception rule. If proxy listener is not set, add a new one for the IP address **127.0.0.1** and bind it to port **8080**  

![burp5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225860075-625f06c2-713a-4aa3-b5c3-17fe59ef54c7.PNG)  

#### Installing Firefox and FoxyProxy  

In this exercise we will use **Firefox** as our browser. Please install it before proceeding.  

We want Firefox to use the BurpSuite as our proxy, so that we can intercept and modify traffic going trough our browser.  

Install a Firefox plug-in called FoxyProxy from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/  

![foxyproxy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225860307-0c4e3db4-7e3a-4e62-8493-809fbbb57fcc.PNG)

Add FoxyProxy to your browser. After that, click on the top right corner to show your extensions and click on FoxyProxy  

![foxyproxy1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225860395-b03cba99-06c4-445b-a6ce-20c82e22e35d.PNG)

Now you should be here. Click Add to create a new proxy setting.  

![foxyproxy2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225860456-9317e66b-d55c-458e-8fef-d88085c8848f.PNG)

Add the same settings as you did to the Proxy settings in BurpSuite and click Save.  

![foxyproxy3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225860523-fb7de636-9d56-4765-b05e-998bb96580e5.PNG)

Now you should be able to turn on the newly created proxy setting from the Firefox extensions. Since we selected our proxy type to be HTTP, you *should not/should not be able to* visit HTTPS sites in this browser while this setting is on.  

![foxyproxy4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225860692-59104032-e902-492e-93e6-f38c28b87ec6.PNG)

#### Running DVWA

**Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)** is an intentionally vulnerable website for testing different web vulnerabilities. It is listed in the OWASP Vulnerable Web Applications Directory (https://owasp.org/www-project-vulnerable-web-applications-directory/) and has a GitHub Repository at (https://github.com/digininja/DVWA). It also has a Docker image at (https://hub.docker.com/r/vulnerables/web-dvwa/)  

Before proceeding check that your Virtual Machine's networking mode is set to NAT. In VirtualBox it can be checked from network settings in the bottom right corner.   

We installed Docker Engine to streamline the setup of this web application. We can simply run the image by running the following command in terminal  

>docker run --rm -it -p 80:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa  

If everything was successful, you should be able to access DVWA via http://localhost/  

![dvwa login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225860828-023e7f7d-85cf-4bff-97f9-bf2e90fa1c88.PNG)

Enter the site with credentials  
Username: **admin**  
Password: **password**  

Scroll to the bottom of the page and initialize the database  

![dvwa 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225860916-2161939d-add1-4f10-8063-84e04691c6d1.PNG)

After this you will be returned to the login page and we can start learning few features of BurpSuite.  

## **Subtask 1**: Intercepting

Right now we have setup our proxy in a way that all communications between Firefox and localhost goes trough BurpSuite.

Open the Proxy tab in BurpSuite and go to HTTP history. If you followed the instructions, there should be already some GET and POST requests visible. You can create more by attempting to login with wrong credentials. Here is a captured example with username=admin and password=hello  

![burp6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225861070-8ed0edbd-5d87-4611-8ed6-2c6069e27666.PNG)

Now go to the **Intercept** tab and turn interception on  

![interception1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225861142-66179b6f-3728-49e1-aee9-5eadd96aeeb5.PNG)

Now enter the site with credentials  
Username: **admin**  
Password: **password**  

The site should be frozen since we have intercepted the POST request. We can now modify the request as we like in BurpSuite. Go ahead and modify the User-Agent highlighted in the picture below. Type into the user agent your name + name of a random household item. After you have done the modification, release the POST request by pressing **Forward**. Also forward the GET request but there is no need to modify it.  

![interception2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225861303-69ecc52f-ca2c-40a0-97f9-bb50fb9e827b.PNG)

Turn off interception and find the edited request from HTTP history. As your returnable, add a screenshot of your edited post so that all the following information is visible.  

-**Listing of the last POST and GET request including timestamps and port**  
-**Atleast 15 rows of the Edited POST request in Raw format**  

## **Subtask 2**: Repeater

in the DVWA, go to the **DVWA Security** Tab and raise the security level from *Low* to *Medium* and click **Submit**  

Now go the **Weak session IDs** Tab and press **Generate**. This creates a cookie called *dvwaSession*.  

Generating the new session ID should show up in your HTTP history as a POST request. Right click the request and select **Send to Repeater**. Move to the highlighted Repeater tab  

![repeater1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225861807-5921d774-e322-4b6d-9753-be438c685fef.PNG)

With the Repeater we can send previously sent request as many times as we want and even modify them. You can repeat the request by pressing **Send**. Below the request you can see the response.  

For your next returnable, try to figure out how the **dvwaSession** cookie is generated by looking at the response after multiple repeats. Return a brief explanation on how a new cookie is generated and a screenshot where atleast 15 lines of code is visible from both a Request and a corresponding Response in Raw or Pretty format.  

## **Subtask 3**: Intruder

In DVWA, Set the security back to *Low* and **Submit**. Then go to the **Brute Force** tab  

Try to login with credentials  
Username: **user**  
Password: **pass**  

Now go to HTTP history, right click on the GET request and click **Send to Intruder**. Move to the highlighted Intruder tab.  

![intruder1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225862133-b3a25abc-df72-4a25-a993-680c9aafb050.PNG)

Intruder has automatically detected few payload positions. Remove these by pressing **Clear §**. Since we are only interested in brute forcing user credentials, we want to add a payload to the username and password variables. Highlight *user* and *pass* and insert those payload positions with **Add §**. The end result should look like this.  

![intruder3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225862358-e57dc688-c2c0-4352-afc1-d7b2d33db50b.PNG)

Since we are simultaneously using multiple payload positions, choose the attack type **Cluster Bomb** from the drop down menu.  

Move to the **Payloads** tab. Here we can insert our credentials we want to test. Payload sets 1 and 2 represent 'username' and 'password' positions respectively.  

We could import a huge list of credentials if we wanted to. However the Community Edition has throttled performance and would take a long time iterating through long lists. Instead we will manually add few items.  

To Payload set 1 add the following items:  
**admin**  
**gordonb**  
**Your first name**  
**Your surname**  

To Payload set 2 add the following items:  
**password**  
**abc123**  
**letmein**  
**password123**  
**Your first name**  
**Your surname**  

End results should look something like this:  

![intruder4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225862527-f8edb39b-eeb7-4ae5-904a-64d5c7a8f60f.PNG)
![intruder5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225862547-551daa46-617e-44e8-b7b0-7354e4242981.PNG)

From the top right corner click **Start Attack**  

Inspect the results. Which bruteforce attemps were successful? Explain how did you come to this conclusion and what kind of evidence did you find from the responses?
Return the explanation along with a screenshot where all 24 attempts are listed. If you find evidence of a successful attempt from the responses, include it in the screenshot.  

## **Subtask 4**: Decoder

As a last task, we will take a quick look a the **Decoder** tab.  

While dealing with many kinds of requests we constantly come across decoded data  

Open the **Decoder** and write your name and student number into the first section.  

![decoder1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225862736-1c7fefc6-697e-45f2-b94f-f5e23e2bac35.PNG)

Then **Encode** it as **URL**

![decoder2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225862810-89ff0cec-aead-4ce8-a0f7-5b7bdb5a763e.PNG)

Then **Encode** it as **HTML**

![decoder3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225862886-4f932491-9e5e-4244-a10a-83287c03ede3.PNG)

Finally use the **Smart Decode** function. Return a screenshot of all the encoded and decoded results.

## **Clean up**

After getting your results you can close BurpSuite. Remember, that the BurpSuite project is temporary and you cannot access the results after closing.  

Go to Firefox and Turn off FoxyProxy  

![foxyproxyquit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225862992-7d1ecb1f-7fbd-4b35-a4d6-24ba16070095.PNG)

To close the docker image of DVMA, open the terminal window where docker is active and press **Ctrl+C**. This should close the image. You can verify this with the command  

>docker info  

![docker stop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44393530/225863084-e0e0ec21-9b46-480f-9603-a3bd5b72a4fa.PNG)

Return your PDF containing all returnables to the Moodle return box
