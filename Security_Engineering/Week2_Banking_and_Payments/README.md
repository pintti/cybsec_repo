```


```

## Requirements

This task requires `docker`.

## Summary

You have been tasked to test a new banking application developed by an intern at OUSPG which is riddled with bugs and flaws
in software design. In this exercise we will mainly look over the most obvious flaws in the application and focus on
subdomain takeover.

During development the application was created with a microservice architecture in mind and was originally deployed to
an application platform hosted by a hosting provider. However, later in development the service was moved to run on its
own servers and most of the microservice components were retired.

In this task you will get to familiarize yourself on how a subdomain takeover could happen and what effects it could
have. You will get to inspect a very simple web application and figure out how it works. You will also need to write
your own simple web server to receive data.

Completing this exercise will help you familiarize yourself with your browsers developer tools and Python programming.

## Task

To get started run `docker compose up` and follow the next few steps:

1. Open your browser to http://bank.ouspg.org.localhost:8080/
    - You should now see a screen with option `login` and `register`
    - Register a user to the site (for example `a` and `a`)
2. You should now be in the home screen again with a view of your balance and an option to send money.
3. Now logout from the application.

As this is all running locally, the subdomain takeover is not done by inspecting DNS, but rather analyzing faults within
the website itself.

#### Subdomain Takeover

Open up the [home page](http://bank.ouspg.org.localhost:8080/) again and the developer tools of your browser
(alt + f12).

__Task 1:__ Find out what the application does when you log in

- What methods get called and where?
    - _See the network tab of your browser's developer tools as well as the console_
- What data gets saved?
    - _See the storage tab of your browser's developer tools_
- Is any data sent to external services?
    - _You can inspect the request headers and body via developer tools_
- Is there anything hazardous about the login process?

```
Methods that get called when you login are a login POST method to login backend, which in turn refers the request to multiple different urls like rss.bank, bss.bank etc. A cookie is stored that last only for the session, but nothing else seems to be stored. The username is sent to external services. Regarding hazardous materials with the login process, the password is sent as-is, and is not obfuscated or hashed or anything. That's bad.

```

__Task 2:__ Figure out which subdomain of the application is vulnerable to takeover

- How did you figure out the domain?
- How can you find out the hosting provider after finding out the domain?

```


```

<details>
    <summary>Hints</summary>

Try and see if any response in the network tab differs from the others.
Then try and navigate to that address while keeping an eye on your developer tools.
Inspect any responses you receive while investigating the domains.

</details>

__Task 3:__ Taking over the domain

Now that you found the target domain and the hosting provider, make an assumption that the subdomain was running in the
app engine of the provider. We will be simulating a small cloud provider which handles their ipv4 allocation by simply
provisioning them via roundrobin for any servers joining their app platform.

- Visit the imaginary cloud provider management portal at http://hosting-provider.org.localhost:8080/servers/docs
- Try out the functionality of the API portal and try to get the IP of the target subdomain under your control
    - You can see this by monitoring the target subdomain for a change in response

In this case the IP range is very small, and you can perform this task manually. However, in any real scenario the pool
of ip addresses would be big enough to warrant automation. Create a script to automatically provision servers until you
get the desired domain by utilizing the underlying API of the management portal:

```


```

<details>
    <summary>Hints</summary>

You can look at the _Network_ tab of you browsers developer tools while using the management page.
See any requests and their content when you click buttons on the page.
You can also use the inspect feature on most browsers and look into the page source.

For the script, you can use the `requests` library in python:

```python
import requests as r

r.post('http://my-server/my-path', json={
    'data': 'value'
})
```

</details>

__Task 4:__ Hijacking data

Your task is to create an application that collects users that log in to the application and hijacks their session if
they navigate to your subdomain page.

If you have trouble receiving the login callback data from the banking application, familiarize yourself with
[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) and make required adjustments.

Test your application by creating another user in the banking application and by navigating to your site.
You should be able to transfer all their money to your account.
You should also be able to receive callbacks from the banking application when users log in.

Place your code in the [create_your_server.py](create_your_server.py) file.

<details>
    <summary>Hints</summary>

Try and inspect the banking application and see what data it sends during login.
Also, inspect what data you possibly want to get from users when they land on your page.

You can take inspiration from [analytics.py](analytics.py)

You can use the provided script and add endpoints as follows:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Response, Cookie
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class MyAPIModel(BaseModel):
    value: str


@app.options('/')
def my_function(request: Request, response: Response):
    ...


@app.get('/')
def my_function(cookie_value: Cookie(alias='my-cookie')):
    return {
        'my-data': 'is-json'
    }


@app.post('/')
def my_function(model: MyAPIModel):
    ...

```

You can see the intro for [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/) for more guidance.

</details>

To finish off run `docker compose down -v` to delete any residual volumes.

__Task 5:__ Questions

- Now you were able to take over the user session. Imagine a situation where you would only get the
  callback when they log in. Why would even this information be useful for attackers?

```


```

- How can subdomain takeovers be prevented?

```


```

- What additional protections could an organization do to prevent abuse even if a subdomain takeover occurs?

```


```

## Additional Questions

Normally you could do subdomain recon via DNS queries to find domains that exist, but do not lead anywhere.

- Does the tool `nmap` have any useful scripts or plugins to find out (un)used subdomains for a site?
- What kind of arguments would you use to find subdomains for `example.com`?
- Are there any other tools or services to find out subdomains for a server?

```


```

Additionally, some good resources for domain discovery are __Passive DNS__  and __Certificate Transparency Logs__.
Research online what are they and how could you utilize them for subdomain takeover and summarize it in a few sentences:

```


```

A way to find out the hosting provider for a site is by seeing if it has a `PTR` record automatically configured by the
hosting provider in DNS.

What is a `PTR` Record?

```


```

Only looking at DNS data, can you tell who hosts the domain `ouspg.org`

```


```

(Optional) Take a look at the code for the [banking application](bank.py) and find out at least three major points where the
development has gone terribly wrong. Summarize in a few sentences to what type of attacks could the application be
vulnerable to or what major security flaws it has:

```


```
