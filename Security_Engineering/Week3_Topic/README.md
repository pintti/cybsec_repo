Task 1.

Technological lock-in mean a situation where a technology attains a monopoly on the market without actually being a monopoly. Either individuals or organizations become so dependent on the technology, that switching to alternative technologies becomes almost impossible, even if those technologies are more efficient or cost-effective. 
   
A good example in real life is Microsoft and Windows. Windows is run on around 80% of desktops worldwide1. Most office spaces only offer Windows computers, using Windows software. Companies could switch to other operating systems, but the switch is too big of a hurdle for most companies. Personally, I am also trapped under Windows, as Windows is easily the best OS for videogames. Everything else I could do with Linux, but unfortunately videogames are almost always optimized for Windows and nothing else. Steam is trying to fight against this with Proton and SteamOS, but that is still far away from ideal.

Costs that come with leaving lock-in are the costs that come with acquiring the new technology, then retraining and adapting to that technology. Compatibility issues can arise with other systems. Harms of being in a lock-in are reduced efficiency and vulnerabilities that come with the system. Benefits of the lock-in can be added compatibility with others who are in the same lock-in.

Task 2.

Phishing attacks work because people human behaviour is rather easily exploitable. When people get an email claiming their account has been taken over, or they have made a mistake somewhere that needs urgent fixing, most people want to urgently fix that without checking if the claim is true or not. Most people do not think about worst-case scenarios, so they might not even realize they are being socially engineered and are going to get scammed.

For phishing good examples of this include anchoring bias, where a scammer acts like something urgent is needed to do, which encourages the victim to act quickly without actually thinking things through, or conditioning, where scammer slowly reinforces the victim into acting like they want, either by acting like a trusted party or provides small rewards, and the use of social psychology where scammers act like authorities or create fake accounts that claim what the scammer is saying or doing is true and trusted.

Passwords are another part where the human psychology comes into play. Secure password are long, contain multiple words, have numbers and special characters in them and so on. These are hard to remember and if every password has to be unique, there is even more to remember. But people prefer convenience to security, at least with passwords, and thus use insecure passwords they can remember easily and in multiple places, so an attacker can easily breakthrough the password and then gains access to all of your accounts.

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is technically a really solid protocol for email privacy. However there are some caveats to the protocol. First is that it relies on a web of trust. This web of trust is built slowly and can rely on third parties first making sure the other party is trusted. However, this can be exploited with fake accounts and such, and majorly, users generally disregard the web of trust completely and just blindly trust the public keys. Another bad part with PGP is that it is hard to use compared to modern emails that just send messages when you ask them to. Again, humans crave convenience rather than security. There is also the efail vulnerability, but I will set that aside as it does not pertain to human psychology.

Lastly, malware spreads easily as people are way too easy to trick into downloading files they want if it is conveniently available. One notable example of this is Limewire. Limewire is a peer-to-peer file sharing client that was used to pirate a lot of music back in the 2000-2010. There were a lot of files that were actual music, but also files .exe files disguising themselves as music. As people launched these files, malware spread.

Task 3A.

IP-, copyright-, patent- and trademark laws were created to protect creators and their properties from unjust copying and allows them to monetarily benefit from their creations. Copyright laws protect original works, like literary, musical, artistic and few other intellectual works. Thanks to copyright laws creators have exclusive right to distribute, perform, display and licence their work. Patent laws ensure that inventors are protected from their inventions being copied for a set time. Finally trademark laws protect symbols, logos and phrases that distinguish products and companies from each other. Trademarks also help users to recognize the company.

But even though these laws exist, copying exist and will always exist. This is why a lot of creators and companies use technologies like watermarks, licences, DRM and sofware protection dongles. Lets go over these now.

Watermarks are small marks that contain information relating to either the creator, user or licence of whatever the watermark is added into. Watermarks can be visible or invisible. Most oftenly used in digital media, like with Stock Photos where the images you can find on image search have large watermarks on them to make users pay for the photos to add to their projects. However, watermarks can also be added to things like software, where the watermark is embedded within data, physical objects, where the watermark is a small sign or such, and videogames, where the watermark may be your username and/or licence located in a corner of the screen.

Software licences are legal agreements between software creators/publishers and users. The licences can range from very strict to very lax, and depending on their contents users can freely copy, modify and distribute the software forward, or use it in a very specific way where any other usage makes the user eligible for licence revoke or fines. Almost every software we use have licences, and the terms we agree to are listed in huge walls of text nobody has the time to read. This has caused some problems relating to licences, where the licence may have clauses that can be outright illegal, but the software owners would still argue that the user agreed to it. Users not reading EULAs has also led to some rather hilarious cases, like users selling their souls.

DRM (Digital Rights Management) are technologies and techniques that control the access, usage and distribution of digital content. DRM technologies use encryption, authentication and licensing mechanisms to protect the product from unlawful copying, distribution and modification. Denuvo is currently the largest DRM company regarding videogames, and while their DRM solution does protect software from getting cracked easily, it also introduces a lot of problems that can cause the software to run worse.

Software protection dongles are pieces of hardware meant to protect software. The dongles contain unique identifiers or encyption keys that are required for the software to work. By tying the access to a software to a physical device, you can be sure that only authorized users can accessthe software, even if it is copied and shared to another device. One example of this is crypto ledgers, that contain the private keys of users wallets.
