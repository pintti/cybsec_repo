## Task 1

Final week huh. Time really does fly, especially when you have seven courses in addition to this one. I have already given feedback anonymously but I do not mind answering here too.

Due to a very busy schedule I was not able to attend very many lectures, but the few I attended I generally liked. The lectures were not overly long, nor were the slides pumped up with information, rather the lecturer let the talking do the work.

These exercises were very fun. Some of the latter tasks were very hard, but as a second year student I never expected to get too far with them anyways. The first two tasks were always doable though. I can not come up with any improvements for the exercises, they were fun all around and trying to solve some of the latter ones was a fun challenge even if I could not yet solve them.

Worst part of the course was that I did not have nearly enough time to put into this course as I would have liked. This was easily the best course I had in this period, but due to this course being an optional course I had to focus on the others more. Will likely take this again next year when I have more time.

## Task 2

### Task 2.1

![Random](src/Quantum_circ_1.png?raw=true "Mishmash")

Here is my magnificent quantum circuit. I made it by throwing things around and then looking at what happened. Right now the circuit favourably collapses into odd bit amounts.

### Task 2.2

![00](src/Quantum_circ_2_0.png?raw=true "00 state")

Here is the original circuit. 

While the circuit looked rather complex at first, we can get all the states we want by simply removing the logic gates that are in the circuit already. Pictures should be attached below.
